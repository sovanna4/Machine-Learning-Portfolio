# Machine-Learning-Portfolio
A repository to showcase the "Intro to Machine Learning" course assignments and projects I've worked on

# Overview of Machine Learning
In this document [here](Overview_of_ML.pdf) I go over what machine learning is, its relationship with AI, some examples of modern machine learning applications, and my personal interest in machine learning.

# Data Exploration
In this [report](data exploration/data_exploration_report.pdf) I talk about the importance of mean, median, range, covariance, and correlation as statistical measures, as well as provide the output of my code. My code for this assignment can be found [here](data exploration/main.cpp)
