# Machine-Learning-Portfolio
Portfolio to showcase machine learning assignments and projects
In this document [here](Overview_of_ML.pdf) I go over what machine learning is, its relationship with AI, some examples of modern machine learning applications, and my personal interest in machine learning.

# Data Exploration
In this [report](data_exploration_report.pdf) I talk about the importance of mean, median, range, covariance, and correlation as statistical measures, as well as provide the output of my code. My code for this assignment can be found [here](main.cpp)

# Linear Models
In this [R notebook](regression1.Rmd) we cover linear regression - found [here](regression1.pdf). And in this [R notebook](Classification.Rmd) we cover logistic regression and naive bayes - found [here](Classification.pdf).

# ML Algorithms from Scratch
In this project we develop a logistic regression model - found [here](log_reg.cpp). Additionally we cover the naive bayes model - found [here](naive_bayes.cpp). You can find our analyses in this [pdf](MLAlgorithmsfromScratch.pdf).

# Similarity and Ensemble
In this project I worked with a team of 5 to gain experience in similarity models kNN and decision trees. I was responsible for the classificaiton notebook using logistic regression, kNN, and decision trees. The pdf to that notebook can be found [here](Similarity_and_Ensemble_Classification.pdf)

# ML with sklearn
In this assignment I gained experience with sklearn while working in Google's Colaboratory. You can find my notebook [here](ML_with_sklearn.ipynb) and the respective pdf to that notebook [here](ML_with_sklearn.pdf)

# Portfolio Wrap-Up
While in this machine learning course, I have gained valuable experience working on projects using R, Python, and C++. I've been introduced to supervised and unsupervised learning, and deep learning. Moreover, I have been able to work with datasets ranging from small to large, cleaning and preparing it for my own analysis. I've been able to visualize data through graphs, charts, and more. So overall, I am very pleased with what I have learned while in this class and am extremely appreciative that I was able to get some hands-on experience through projects. After going through this course, I now understand the importance of machine learning and how essential it is in decision making, identifying patterns, making predictions, etc. I look forward to one day contributing to machine learning solutions in my future career.
