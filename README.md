# Machine-Learning-Portfolio
Portfolio to showcase machine learning assignments and projects
In this document [here](Overview_of_ML.pdf) I go over what machine learning is, its relationship with AI, some examples of modern machine learning applications, and my personal interest in machine learning.

# Data Exploration
In this [report](data_exploration_report.pdf) I talk about the importance of mean, median, range, covariance, and correlation as statistical measures, as well as provide the output of my code. My code for this assignment can be found [here](main.cpp)

# Linear Models
In this [R notebook](regression1.Rmd) we cover linear regression - found [here](regression1.pdf). And in this [R notebook](Classification.Rmd) we cover logistic regression and naive bayes - found [here](Classification.pdf).

# ML Algorithms from Scratch
In this project we develop a logistic regression model - found [here](log_reg.cpp). Additionally we cover the naive bayes model - found [here](naive_bayes.cpp). You can find our analyses in this [pdf](MLAlgorithmsfromScratch.pdf).

# Similarity and Ensemble
In this project I worked with a team of 5 to gain experience in similarity models kNN and decision trees. I was responsible for the classificaiton notebook using logistic regression, kNN, and decision trees. The pdf to that notebook can be found [here](Similarity_and_Ensemble_Classification.pdf)

# ML with sklearn
In this assignment I gained experience with sklearn while working in Google's Colaboratory. You can find my notebook [here](ML_with_sklearn.ipynb) and the respective pdf to that notebook [here](ML_with_sklearn.pdf)

# Image Classification
In this assignment I build three models to try and classify images as different chess pieces. The cnn model can be found [here](image-classification-cnn.ipynb), the sequential model [here](image-classification-sequential.ipynb), and finally the pre-trained model [here](image-classification-pre-trained.ipynb)
